<a><b>I cannot be bothered making this page look pretty</b><a>
<br>
<br>
<a>Currently Avaliable Skins:</a>
<a id="skins"><b>loading</b></a>
<br>
<br>
<a>To use a skin set your name exactly to the name of the skin</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a>Upload your own skin (PNG ONLY)</a>
<br>
<a>Whatever the file you upload is called is what the skin name will be (eg. the file "fish.png" will become the skin name "fish")</a>
<br>
<a>The file name (including the .png) must only be 15 characters at most!</a>
<br>
<a>You cannot override other skins</a>
